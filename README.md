# barcode-scanner
Mostly stashing this so I don't forget or loose it.

In order to run this script you need:
* python -m pip install opencv-python
* python -m pip install pyzbar

Tested using Python 3.8.1 

I successfully decoded the test barcode included using: "python .\test.py -i .\test.jpg"

And got the corret output of:

[INFO] Found EAN13 barcode: 0658551827296
